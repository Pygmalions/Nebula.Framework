# Nebula Framework

Nebula is an micro-service platform, providing RPC, IoC, AOP and other mechanism.
This framework is mainly **designed for robots AI system development**,
and its main concept is to provide developers with proven techniques which are commonly used in Web development.

What you see here is the main framework of the whole Nebula Platform. 
Now we only finish the fundamental functions of the framework, such as proxying, injection, continuable exception handling.
Out goal is to provides not only a framework, but a solid and complete platform,
including developer toolkits (e.g., motion controller kit, machine learning support, etc), 
and **Nebula Studio** (a visual management application).
